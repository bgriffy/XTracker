---

## 3) Workouts Page

**Description**
The “home base” showing the workout cards the user has chosen to keep handy.

**Layout & Content**

* **Workout Card**

  * Title, duration, #exercises, equipment, difficulty
  * **Primary Button:** **Log Workout** (only visible button)
  * **⋯ Card Menu:**

    * **History** (workout-specific history list)
    * **Edit Template** (opens template in Template Editor)
    * **Remove** (removes card from Workouts page only; template remains)

* **Add Workout** (global button)

  * “Add from Template” modal → pick any template to show as a card

**Behavior**
Cards reflect the current version of their associated template. Removing a card does not delete the template.

---

## 4) Detail Page (Logging a Workout)

**Description**
Where a session is performed and logged; minimal clutter, autosave-first design.

**Header**

* Workout title, date/time
* **Template Origin**: “From template: \[Template Name]” (view-only summary link)
* **Finish** (primary) → marks complete and closes (see Finish logic below)
* **⋯ Session Menu:**

  * **Add Exercise** → opens Exercise Picker (from **Exercises** library) to insert into the current session; user selects destination **round** (or creates a new round)
  * **Add Round** -> Lets user add a new round to group exerecises into. 
  * **Save Changes To Template…** → prompts before saving structure back to the template (creates a new template version for future sessions)
  * **Notes** → opens session-level notes panel
  * **Clear Prefills** (this session)
  * **Discard Session** (confirm)
  * **Manage Hidden (Session)**

**Notes Panel (Session-Level)**

* **Last Session Notes** (read-only)
* **Current Session Notes** (editable, autosaves)

**Body: Rounds & Exercises**

* Organized into **Rounds** (Round 1, Round 2, …)
* **Exercise Rows** (fields shown depend on exercise type; all prefilled from last session where available):

  * **Reps/Weight** exercises → Reps + Weight
  * **Time-based** exercises → Time (mm\:ss)
  * **Reps-only** exercises → Reps
  * **Hybrid** exercises → any combination (Reps, Weight, Time)
* **⋯ Row Menu:**

  * **Hide** (hide this exercise for the current session only)
  * **Notes** (per-exercise notes panel: last session vs current session)
* **Movement & Order:**

  * Drag handles to reorder within a round, move between rounds, and reorder rounds
  * **No “Remove”** option on exercise rows (hide-only)

**Autosave**
All metric changes, order changes, and notes auto-save continuously.

**Finish Logic**

* On **Finish**, if **structural changes** were made in this session (any of: reordering rounds/exercises, adding exercises, hiding/unhiding exercises, creating/removing rounds) **and** the user hasn’t saved them to the template:

  * Show prompt:

    * **Save changes to template** (applies structure back to the template as a new version for future sessions), or
    * **Don’t save** (complete the session; structure remains session-only), or
    * **Cancel** (stay on Detail)
* If no structural changes, Finish just marks complete and closes.

## 5) Workout Templates Page

**Description**
Hub for creating and editing workout templates (including P90X presets).

**Layout & Content**

* **Template List** (all templates, incl. original P90X)

  * Actions: **Edit**, **Duplicate**, **Reset to Original (P90X)**
* **Create Template:** **Start from Original P90X** (pristine) or **Start from Scratch**

**Template Editor**

* Drag/drop to add/remove/reorder **Rounds** and **Exercises**
* Add from **Exercise Library**; set **exercise type** (Reps/Weight, Time, Reps-only, Hybrid)
* Set defaults (targets, hidden by default, equipment)
* Save → creates a **new template version** (future sessions use latest)

---

## 6) History Page

**Description**
Source of truth for what was actually performed—independent of later template edits.

**Content**

* **Global History** (chronological) with filters (workout, date range, notes search)
* **Session Detail** (read-only): date/time, workout name, exact rounds & exercises performed, metrics (reps/weight/time), notes, totals (volume/duration)

**Rule**
History renders from the session snapshot; template changes never retro-edit past sessions.

---

## 7) Exercises Page (Library)

**Description**
Searchable library powering both Templates and the session **Add Exercise** flow.

**Content**

* Search/filter by name, type, tags, equipment
* Exercise detail: description, cues, aliases, equipment
* **Exercise Types** (determine fields on Detail): Reps/Weight · Time-based · Reps-only · Hybrid
* User actions: add/edit/delete **custom** exercises

---

## 8) Schedule Page

**Description**
Planner + history navigator for P90X or custom programs.

**Layout & Behavior**

* Calendar grid by phases/weeks with assigned workouts
* **Past date:**

  * Logged → open that session in **History**
  * Unlogged → option to **Log Retroactively** (opens Detail with that date)
* **Today/Future date:** open **Detail** for logging (current template version)
* Completed days auto-mark when a session finishes; missed days can shift

---

## 9) Statistics Page

**Description**
Analytics to visualize progress and consistency.

**Content**
Charts: volume (weight×reps), time-based improvements, adherence/frequency · Highlights: PRs, streaks, deltas

---

## 10) Rules & Constraints

* **Autosave & Finish**: everything saves continuously; **Finish** closes and marks complete; if unsaved structural changes exist, prompt to “Save changes to template”
* **Templates vs Sessions**: template editing mainly on Templates page; Detail has explicit **Save Changes To Template…** with confirm and versioning
* **No Predefined vs Custom split**: all templates editable; P90X baselines can be reset to original
* **Hidden vs No Remove**: exercise **Hide** is session-only; **Remove** is intentionally not offered on Detail
* **Exercise Type Logic**: exercise type dictates which fields (Reps, Weight, Time) appear; hybrids can show multiple
* **Unobtrusive Editing**: structural actions live behind ⋯ menus and drag handles to keep logging clean
