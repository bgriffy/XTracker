# General Project Rules

## Terminal Commands
- Always run commands with **absolute paths** and as **single-line** statements.
- Use this format:  
  `cd C:\Source\Repos\XTracker\<directory> && <command>`

## Run / Build Workflow (Windows, PowerShell)
- **When asked to run the app, run the build script at this location from the project root:**
```
run command pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts\build.ps1"
```
After running the command, wait five seconds and check output for any errors.

> Notes:
> - Do **not** split commands across lines.  
> - Do **not** add delays or confirmations unless explicitly asked.  
> - If a kill step fails because the process isn’t running, ignore (it’s already silenced).
> - If you've only made a frontend change, do not rebuild the application.

## One-off Backend Kill (anytime you need to stop it)
- Preferred silent command:  
  `taskkill /F /IM XTracker.Api.exe >$null 2>&1`


## Git 
 - When I ask you to commit changes to git, just do it one command, I.E. 
   ```
   git add . && git commit -m "{message-goes-here}"
   ```
 - Use the following when creating commit messages: 
        FORMAT:
        <type>(<scope>): <subject>
        <BLANK LINE>
        <body>
        <BLANK LINE>
        <footer>


        TERMS:

        feat: for a new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a MINOR version.
        fix: for a bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version.
        perf: for performance improvements. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version.
        docs: for changes to the documentation.
        style: for formatting changes, missing semicolons, etc.
        refactor: for refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable.
        test: for adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change.
        build: for updating build configuration, development tools or other changes irrelevant to the user.
        BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
