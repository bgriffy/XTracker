### Description: Create backend services for weekly and monthly data aggregation to support trend visualization
### Details:
Develop aggregation logic to group workout data by week and month. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed aggregated data. Create methods for calculating trends and comparing periods.

## 4. Add Chart Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Integrate a charting library and create reusable chart components for visualizing workout data
### Details:
Select and integrate a React-compatible charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts). Create reusable components for line charts, bar charts, and progress indicators. Implement responsive design for charts on different screen sizes.

## 5. Implement Stats Dashboard UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive dashboard UI that displays all statistics and progress visualizations
### Details:
Design and implement a dashboard layout with sections for summary statistics, streak information, progress charts, and historical comparisons. Add filters for time periods and workout types. Ensure mobile-friendly design with appropriate layout adjustments.
