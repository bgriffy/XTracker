# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Workout History and Progress Tracking Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 20, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive workout history interface with filtering, sorting, and progress tracking capabilities, including a dedicated History tab and individual workout history views with exercise visibility management.
# Details:
1. Create History Tab Component:
   - Implement tab navigation in workouts page
   - Design responsive grid/list view for workout history
   - Add date range picker for filtering
   - Implement sorting by date, workout type, duration
   - Add search functionality for workout names/notes

2. Individual Workout History View:
   - Create detailed history view component for each workout type
   - Implement progress charts showing performance metrics over time
   - Add exercise-specific history tracking
   - Display trend analysis for weights, reps, and duration
   - Include comparison view between workout instances

3. Exercise Management Interface:
   - Create exercise visibility toggle component
   - Implement persistent exercise visibility preferences
   - Add bulk actions for show/hide operations
   - Create exercise organization interface
   - Store visibility settings in user preferences

4. Data Management:
   - Implement client-side caching for performance
   - Add pagination for large history sets
   - Create data aggregation utilities for progress metrics
   - Implement export functionality for workout data
   - Add data filtering hooks and utilities

5. State Management:
   - Design Redux slices for history management
   - Implement optimistic updates for visibility toggles
   - Create action creators for history operations
   - Add error handling and recovery mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test history filtering and sorting functions
   - Verify date range calculations
   - Test progress calculation algorithms
   - Validate exercise visibility toggle logic
   - Test state management functions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify history data loading and pagination
   - Test exercise visibility persistence
   - Validate progress tracking calculations
   - Test data export functionality
   - Verify filter/sort combinations

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Complete workflow for viewing workout history
   - Test exercise visibility management
   - Verify progress tracking accuracy
   - Test responsive design across devices
   - Validate sorting and filtering operations

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure load times with large datasets
   - Test caching effectiveness
   - Verify smooth scrolling with pagination
   - Monitor memory usage with extensive history
   - Test concurrent operations handling
