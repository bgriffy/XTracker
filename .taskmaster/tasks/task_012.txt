   - Optimize touch interactions for set logging
   - Implement swipe gestures for navigation
   - Create compact view for exercise history

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test form validation logic for set logging
   - Verify performance calculation functions
   - Test state management logic
   - Validate exercise data display components

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test workout template loading from API
   - Verify workout logging flow end-to-end
   - Test performance history data retrieval
   - Validate exercise database integration

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify responsive design across devices
   - Test touch interactions on mobile devices
   - Validate form accessibility
   - Check performance with large exercise sets

4. Performance Testing:
   - Load testing with multiple workout histories
   - Verify caching mechanisms
   - Test chart rendering performance
   - Measure page load times with full data

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify workout logging workflow
   - Test exercise history visualization
   - Validate performance tracking accuracy
   - Check mobile usability
