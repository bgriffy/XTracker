# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Workout Form Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a form component with all required fields for logging workouts
### Details:
Implement a React form component with fields for workout date, type, duration, notes, sets, reps, and weight. Use React Hook Form for state management. Ensure proper field types (date picker, dropdowns, number inputs) and organize layout logically.

## 2. Implement Form Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add validation rules to the workout form using React Hook Form
### Details:
Configure validation rules for all form fields (required fields, min/max values, date constraints). Implement error messages and visual feedback for validation errors. Add client-side validation before submission. Create custom validation rules for workout-specific constraints.

## 3. Create Workout List View with Filtering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a component to display logged workouts with filtering capabilities
### Details:
Create a responsive list/table view of workouts showing key information (date, type, duration). Implement filtering by date range, workout type, and other relevant criteria. Add sorting functionality (newest/oldest, duration, etc.). Include pagination for large datasets.

## 4. Implement API Integration with Optimistic Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Connect UI components to API endpoints with optimistic UI updates
### Details:
Integrate form submission with workout API endpoints. Implement optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback. Handle API errors gracefully with rollback capability. Add loading indicators during API operations while maintaining UI responsiveness.

## 5. Ensure Mobile-Friendly Layout and Polish UI [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Optimize UI components for mobile devices and add loading/error states
### Details:
Implement responsive design for all components using CSS flexbox/grid. Add loading states and skeletons for data fetching operations. Create error state components with retry options. Test and optimize touch interactions for mobile users. Ensure proper form usability on small screens.
